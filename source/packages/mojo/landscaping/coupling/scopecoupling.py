class ScopeCoupling(BaseCoupling):
    """
        The :class:`ScopeCoupling` object is the base object class that is used for scope declaration. :class:`ScopeCoupling`
        derived objects are used to create a hierarchy of scopes that are representative of the scopes of execution
        that are represented by the runtime environment.  These scopes of execution are used to establish the runtime
        contexts that task and test instantiations can be run inside of.  The scopes of a runtime environment are
        typically hierarchical in nature starting with the root object of a tree and build more complexed
        environments as they the hierarchy is ascended.

        The code of the :class:`ScopeCoupling` is divided into class level code and instance level code.  The hierarchy
        of the :class:`ScopeCoupling` derived objects are used by the :class:`akit.testing.unittest.testsequencer.Sequencer`
        object to determine the grouping and order of the tests or tasks to be run.  The class level code of the
        :class:`ScopeCoupling` is run by the :class:`akit.sequencer.Sequencer` object based on the class hierarchy to
        establish the order that scopes are entered and exited as the automation sequence is executed by the
        :class:`akit.testing.unittest.testsequencer.Sequencer` object.  The :class:`ScopeCoupling` class level code, is executed
        before any object that inherits from a :class:`ScopeCoupling` derived object is instantiated, so the state for the
        scope has been establish.

        The :class:`ScopeCoupling` instance level code is utilized to inter-operate with the state of the scope and also
        provides scope specific functionality.

        ..notes :
            A scope represents a predefined state that is reached by the execution of code.  The state represents a
            requirement that is needed to be met in order for a task to be able to run.

            Scopes have a name that is like a file system path /configuration

            Scopes can contain state and they are deposited into the context in a leaf just like other nodes.

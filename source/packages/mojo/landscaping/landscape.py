class Landscape:
    """
        The base class for all derived :class:`Landscape` objects.  The :class:`Landscape`
        object is a singleton object that provides access to the resources and test
        environment level methods.  The functionality of the :class:`Landscape` object is setup
        so it can be transitioned through activation stages:
        
        * Configuration
        * Integration
        * Operational

        The different phases of operation of the landscape allow it to be used for a wider variety
        of purposes from commandline configuration and maintenance operations, peristent services
        and automation run functionality.

        The activation stages or levels of the :class:`Landscape` object are implemented using
        a python MixIn pattern in order to ensure that individual layers can be customized
        using object inheritance while at the same time keeping the object hierarchy simple.

        ..note: The :class:`Landscape` object constructor utilizes the `super` keyword for calling
                the mixin layer constructors using method resolution order or `mro`.  In order for
                `super` to work correctly all objects in the hierarchy should also provide a
                constructor and should also utilize `super`.  This is true also for objects that
                only inherit from :class:`object`. Should you need to create a custom layer override
                object, you must ensure the proper use of `super` in its constructor.
